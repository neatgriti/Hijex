 Wi-Fi-based one-way voice transmitter, where audio is captured on a server (transmitter), sent over Wi-Fi, and played on a client device (receiver). This allows real-time voice streaming over a local network. The system uses Python and libraries like PyAudio and Sockets to handle audio capture, transmission, and playback between devices.
